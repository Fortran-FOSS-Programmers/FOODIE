## What is WenOOF?

Modern Fortran standards (2003+) have introduced support for Object Oriented Programming. Exploiting new features like Abstract Data Type (ADT) is now possible to develop a KISS library for computing Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) interpolation on ADT making the development of new numerical schemes faster, easier and clearer.

### What is WENO?

Starting from the original paper of Liu, Osher and Chan<sup>1</sup> WENO interpolation schemes have gained attention mainly for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) whose solutions admit strong discontinuities as well complex smooth solution features. Consequently, WENO schemes are a common build-block of nonlinear, conservative finite volume methods, however they are not strictly related to the PDEs solution, they being a general, **non linear interpolation (approximation) procedure**.

A clear, yet brief online introduction of WENO schemes family can be found at Prof. Shu's WENO methods page hosted on [scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/WENO_methods).

Since 1994 the WENO literature has _blowing up_, a superficial search on [sciencedirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/) for `weno scheme` resulting in more than 1500 matches. During the last 2 decades many new WENO schemes have been proposed: the efficient implementation of Jiang and Shu<sup>2</sup>, the hybrid Compact-WENO scheme of Pirozzoli<sup>3</sup>, the bandwidth-optimized WENO scheme of Martin et al.<sup>4</sup>, the WENO-Z scheme of Borges et al.<sup>5</sup> and many others.

WenOOF is designed to provide a KISS, Object Oriented Fortran API for computing WENO interpolations accordingly the main relevant WENO schemes ever devised and with a new ones we will develop :-)
