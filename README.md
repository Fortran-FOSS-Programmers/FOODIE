## What is FOODiE?

Modern Fortran standards (2003+) have introduced support for Object Oriented Programming. Exploiting new features like Abstract Data Type (ADT) is now possible to develop a KISS library for integrating Ordinary Differential Equations on ADT making the development of new numerical schemes faster, easier and clearer.

+ [ ] comprehensive:
  + [ ] Runge-Kutta schemes:
  + [ ] predictor-corrector schemes;
  + [ ] explicit;
  + [ ] implicit;
+ [ ] efficient:
  + [ ] high scalability on parallel architectures:
    + [ ] support for shared memory multi/many cores architecture;
    + [ ] support for distributed memory cluster;
    + [ ] support for GPGPU/accelerators device;
+ [ ] well documented:
